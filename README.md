# Permutate
This is a simple tool for doing brute force solutions to annoying but ultimately simple mathematical problems.

Inspired by the following problem:

Given the following set of values: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7  
Order the values so that:  
1) The value in the 6th position is one less than the value in the 5th position  
2) The value in the 6th position is equal to the value in the 2nd position - the value in the 3rd position  
3) The values of the 1st + 6th element is equal to the value of the 3rd + 4th element
